    "##### Types of probability: \n",
    "\n",
    "    Classical Probability : often referred to as the \"priori\" or \"theoretical probability\", states that in an experiment where there are B equally likely outcomes, and event X has exactly A of these outcomes, then the probability of X is A/B, or P(X) = A/B. For example, when a fair die is rolled, there are six possible outcomes that are equally likely. That means, there is a 1/6 probability of rolling each number on the die.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Empirical Probability : The empirical probability or the experimental perspective evaluates probability through thought experiments. For example, if a weighted die is rolled, such that we don't know which side has the weight, then we can get an idea for the probability of each outcome by rolling the die number of times and calculating the proportion of times the die gives that outcome and thus find the probability of that outcome.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Subjective Probability : Subjective probability considers an individual's own belief of an event occurring. For example, the probability of a particular team winning a football match on a fan's opinion is more dependent upon their own belief and feeling and not on a formal mathematical calculation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Axiomatic Probability : In axiomatic probability, a set of rules or axioms by Kolmogorov are applied to all the types. The chances of occurrence or non-occurrence of any event can be quantified by the applications of these axioms, given as:\n",
    "    \n",
    "i. The smallest possible probability is zero, and the largest is one   \n",
    "ii. \n",
    "An event that is certain has a probability equal toone\n",
    "iii. \r\n",
    "Any two mutually exclusive events cannot occur simultaneously, while the union of events says only one of them can occur."
